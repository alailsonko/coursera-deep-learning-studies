# Binary Classification
    Binary classification is the task of classifying the elements of a set into two groups on the basis of a classification rule. Typical binary classification problems include:
    - Predicting whether an individual is likely to have a disease or not.
    - Predicting whether an individual is likely to be admitted to a hospital or not.
    - Quality control in industry, deciding whether a specific product is safe to use or not.
    - In information retrieval, deciding whether a page should be in the result set of a search or not.

    Statistical classification is a problem studied in machine learning. It is a type of supervised learning, a method of machine learning where the categories are predefined, and is used to categorize new probabilistic observations into said categories. When there are only two categories the problem is known as statistical binary classification.

    some of the methods commonly used for binary classification are:
    - Decision trees
    - Random forests
    - Bayesian networks
    - Support vector machines
    - Neural networks
    - Logistic regression
    - Probit model

    Each clasifier is best in only a select domain based upon the number of observations, the dimensionality of the feature vector, the noise in the data and many other factors. For example, random forests perform better than SVM classifiers for 3D point clouds.
