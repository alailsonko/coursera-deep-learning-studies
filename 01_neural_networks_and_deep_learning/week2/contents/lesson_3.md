# Logistic Regression Cost Function
    We learnt about the cost function J(0) in the Linear regression, the cost function represents optimization objective i.e. we create a cost function and minimize it so that we can develop an accurate model with minimum error.

    If we try to use the cost function of the linear regression in 'Logistic Regression' then it would be of no use as it would end up being a non-convex function with many local minimums, in which it would be very difficult to minimize the cost value and find the global minimum.

    For logistic regression, the Cost function is defined as:
    −log(hθ(x)) if y = 1
    −log(1−hθ(x)) if y = 0
