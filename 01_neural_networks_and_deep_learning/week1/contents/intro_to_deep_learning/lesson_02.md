# Supervised Learning with Neural Networks
    Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error been suffiently minimized.

    Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data mining-classification and regression:

    - Classication: uses an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. It recognizes specific entities within the dataset and attempts to draw some conclusions on how those entities should be labeled or defined. Common classification algorithms are linear classifiers, support vector machines, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, which are described in more detail below.

    - Regression: is used to understyand the relationship between dependent and independent variables. It is commonly used to make projections, such as for sales revenue for a given business. Linear regression, logistical regression, and polynomial regression are popular regression algorithms.
